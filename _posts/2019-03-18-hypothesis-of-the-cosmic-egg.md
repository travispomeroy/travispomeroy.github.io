This software blog is mainly here to serve two purposes, one as knowledge dump for myself, 
and two as an opportunity for me to share my understandings of software.  Currently, my 
thoughts are mainly focused on developer productivity and how to achieve predictable results
 with highly focused small teams.  And since I am a software engineer at heart, I will also 
 write blogs and tutorials to help me better understand my opinions on software and to also 
 help me remember what exactly that one Spring annotation does without having to go to S.O. 
 all the time :)
 
 On a personal note, I have an undergraduate degree in software engineering and have spent 
 all of my career in FinTech.  I have worked for big banks and now am currently working at a
  smaller FinTech product company whose clients are the big banks.  
  
What I value in my teams:
* Communication
* Psychological safety
* Healthy Conflict
* Accountability 

What I value in my code:
* Readability
* Maintainability
* Testability
* Business Value
